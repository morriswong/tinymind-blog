All content that starts with K goes to Korea, that quite a strategy of owning a letter of a foreign language.",

    "content": "**The VIP experience of software**\n\nThe strong case of software is that the marginal cost of a new copy of the same experience is near zero. On the other hand, a VIP experience is that it is a unique experience, and it is also the VIP experience that allows one to charge at a premium because VIP experience is expensive.\n\nHow can software be more like VIP? If we follow most innovation, it usually starts from a VIP experience. However, software is usually the opposite, where something went viral and attracted attention, and it growth from there.\n\nLook for experience that you liked, and find out where can you find the same experience but are 10 times more expensive. If you can deliver even more value in the 10 times more expensive setting, you might have a shot.",

I remember I saw almost a dozen IKEA drying racks in the balcony of the whole building.\n\nBut people wanted to feel special and represent themselves. This where the IKEA hack comes in that turn IKEA products around. A shelf and be turned into a stool, a stool can be turned into a side table.\n\nThis reminds me of the template code that we modify it into our own versions. You put different pieces of open source together, then you would have an new app. Maybe IKEA is the physical version of this.\n\n",

And that's why there is now benchmarks that helps you compare LLMs. \n\nHowever benchmarks reminds me of the smartphones back in 2009, where there are tons of benchmarks that compares phone's CPU on what they are capable of. I remember when I new phone launched, I would always look up the geekbench score to tell whether it's a good phone with a good CPU or not.\n\nFast forward to now, we care less about that now. When will we reach to a point that we don't care about LLMs benchmark anymore? What does the get the job done LLMs looks like?",

    "content": "**The safest software**\n\nI was a happy Arc user, their browser is really well thought out and has a lot of useful features. Yet recently it got hit by a serious security incident. The gist of it is that a feature called Boosts that lets you change fonts, colours and even add your own custom CSS or JavaScript ended up became a vulnerability. \n\nIt got fixed now, but it made me think what safety really is in the online world. We know that in the physical world, airplanes are the safest way to travel, but the extra effort that is needed to make it safe is very extreme, like from having two to three sets of pilots and crew members to the notorious security checks in the airport. Despite the hassle, it delivered the safety promise.\n\nHow can a software be truly safe with reasonable compromise on user experience? I got a lot more logins that are now requiring two factor authentication, and I have to say while it is annoying to put in the pin, that 10 seconds of finding the pin and put it in is a lot easier now. Maybe that is the standard of safety for now as baseline.",
