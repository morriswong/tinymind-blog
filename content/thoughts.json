Well organised notebooks or software didn’t “kill” post it notes. Post it notes works just fine.\n\nIf we are in an era that we enable everyone to build, the path from post it notes to a system that people can put a punch card in and it just works is what we should be looking into, because while that is clear to developers, it is still not clear for the rest of the billions of the people to truly be empowered.",

That being said, using website builder as an example, there are still tons of drag and drop website builder out there in the market.\n\nPerhaps it is the segment of software development that makes drag and drop make sense. If the flow is very complicated, chances are first of all, it doesn't have to be that complicated, and if it is indeed a very complicated process, the low code promise doesn't apply here.\n\nHow to identify the threshold where low code made sense? The limit test is whether an average LLM can figure it out a flow, if it is not then maybe it's time to look beyond low code tools.",

I actually don't have any, but I do cold message message people on LinkedIn as well, and here is what I learned so far.\n\n- Treat it like a message in a bottle floating in the sea, you don't expect to hear back\n- Don't ask for a meeting, thank them in advance for reading and responding. The best is thank for their article published online, their talk online, their book. That is of course that you have read it and you are truly appreciated of their work, be specific of your appreciation\n- Only ask them out if you have a clear thing to discuss about them, not about you\n\nSo here are the rule of thumb on how I cold message. The next question is how to covert, but that is another level of networking, let's see how it unfolds.",

On the other hand, a VIP experience is that it is a unique experience, and it is also the VIP experience that allows one to charge at a premium because VIP experience is expensive.\n\nHow can software be more like VIP? If we follow most innovation, it usually starts from a VIP experience. However, software is usually the opposite, where something went viral and attracted attention, and it grows from there.\n\nLook for experience that you liked, and find out where can you find the same experience but are 10 times more expensive. If you can deliver even more value in the 10 times more expensive setting, you might have a shot.",

I remember I saw almost a dozen IKEA drying racks in the balcony of the whole building.\n\nBut people wanted to feel special and represent themselves.

A shelf and be turned into a stool, a stool can be turned into a side table.\n\nThis reminds me of the template code that we modify it into our own versions. You put different pieces of open source together, then you would have an new app. Maybe IKEA is the physical version of this.\n\n",

And that's why there is now benchmarks that helps you compare LLMs. \n\nHowever benchmarks reminds me of the smartphones back in 2009, where there are tons of benchmarks that compares phone's CPU on what they are capable of. I remember when I new phone launched, I would always look up the geekbench score to tell whether it's a good phone with a good CPU or not.\n\nFast forward to now, we care less about that now. When will we reach to a point that we don't care about LLMs benchmark anymore? What does the get the job done LLMs looks like?",

    "content": "**The safest software**\n\nI was a happy Arc user, their browser is really well thought out and has a lot of useful features. Yet recently it got hit by a serious security incident. The gist of it is that a feature called Boosts that lets you change fonts, colours and even add your own custom CSS or JavaScript ended up became a vulnerability. \n\nIt got fixed now, but it made me think what safety really is in the online world. We know that in the physical world, airplanes are the safest way to travel, but the extra effort that is needed to make it safe is very extreme, like from having two to three sets of pilots and crew members to the notorious security checks in the airport. Despite the hassle, it delivered the safety promise.\n\nHow can a software be truly safe with reasonable compromise on user experience? I got a lot more logins that are now requiring two factor authentication, and I have to say while it is annoying to put in the pin, that 10 seconds of finding the pin and put it in is a lot easier now. Maybe that is the standard of safety for now as baseline.",
